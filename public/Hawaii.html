    <h3>An Email from Hawaii</h3>
    <p>Below is an email that I wrote but never sent to you, I hope you like it :)</p>
    <p>Hi Becca!</p>

    <p>I just wanted to say what an incredible trip this has been.</p>

    <p>Right now you are fast asleep on the couch, having read yourself to a slumber. I am watching some barstool reality show and enjoying the sound of rain while over looking the north shore of Kauai. Resting after a day full of beautiful views of the mountains and waterfalls and a morning spent swimming and lounging in Hanalei Bay.

    <p>I have enjoyed so many moments of this trip, here are a few:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Shark Cage diving- I cannot believe you came in that cage with me! You are braver (crazier?) then I ever imagined :) the captain told us that there had been several days of little to no sharks, but we were lucky, and saw THREE tiger sharks- one of which was over 11 ft!! They swam right up to us. I remember the angle in their noses. It was so sharp, I am not sure why it stood out to me, but it was so cool.  I remember their stripes. I remember seeing them in the distance, a distinct shadow you recognize from films and documentaries- the long bodies, the fin sticking up, and the large heads. And then they got closer and closer, swaying in the water. I remember you being frightened- but hanging in there until the end! I feel closer to you, having experienced something so close to the edge. </li>

    <li>Surfing on the North Shore of Oahu- this is unforgettable. The sight from the water was breath taking, the long arm of Oahu stretching off to our right, green and mountainous, splendid and strong. The clear water. A turtle surfing too!  You got “up” a bunch, and so did I :)  we were exhausted but thrilled and happy. Afterwards in town, we got DELICIOUS poke (for the 15th time), and Hawaiian shaved ice. We drove home in our convertible, with the top down, enjoying life and the breeze in our hair. </li>

    <p>As I write this email, I sit and look out at the ocean over the cliffs edge. None of this is possible with out you. We are a team, we got here together.  You pushed me to get here and I am so glad you did. You constantly said “ Hawaii Hawaii Hawaii!!” And I listened (eventually ;) )</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li> A boat tour of the Napoli Coast- well hot damn wasn’t this something- a semi private tour of the Napoli Coast of Kauai. We were on the boat with our Captain, JD, and a family of four, Scott, Jennifer, Luke, and Madeline. They were warm and polite, the kids were well behaved. the perfect company for a boat ride to some the most beautiful sights in the world.  We saw spinner dolphins, and swam with several large sea turtles. We saw the coast unfold before our eyes, the sights getting more and more beautiful with every mile we travelled. The natural and rugged beauty of the shore line and mountains were something I will never forgot. To share this with you was so special, to hold your hand, to put my arm around you, to hold you close, and experience some of the greatest beauties that our world has to offer, is a dream come true.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>I love you dearly Rebecca, and am so grateful to have a loving and adventurous partner to share my life with.</p>

    <p>Lots of Love, </p>
    <p>David</p>
